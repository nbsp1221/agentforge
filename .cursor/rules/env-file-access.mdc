# Environment Files Access Guidelines

## Sensitive Environment Files (.env)

- NEVER attempt to directly access, read, or modify .env files
- .env files contain sensitive credentials and should be treated as secure
- Do not suggest code that reads .env files directly
- Do not use tools like edit_file or read_file on .env files

## Example Environment Files (.env.example)

- .env.example files are meant to be templates and don't contain sensitive data
- IMPORTANT: Cursor blocks direct file access to .env* files including .env.example
- ALWAYS use terminal commands to read .env.example: 
  ```bash
  cat .env.example
  ```
- When editing .env.example, use terminal commands like echo or sed
- Remember that .env.example should document all required variables without exposing sensitive values
