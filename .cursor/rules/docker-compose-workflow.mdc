# Docker Compose Configuration Change Workflow

## Critical Workflow for Configuration Changes

When modifying any Docker Compose configuration (especially `docker-compose.yaml`), always follow this exact sequence:

1. Make changes to your `docker-compose.yaml` file
2. Run `docker-compose down` to completely stop and remove all containers
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to recreate containers with the new configuration

**IMPORTANT: Never use `docker-compose restart` alone when configuration has changed!**

### Why This Matters

Many configuration changes (including but not limited to):
- Healthcheck settings
- Environment variables
- Network configurations
- Volume mounts
- Container dependencies

Are only applied when a container is first created, not when it's restarted. Using only `restart` will leave your containers running with the old configuration.

### Example - Incorrect Workflow:
```
# DON'T DO THIS
1. Edit docker-compose.yaml to change a healthcheck
2. docker-compose restart service_name
3. Wonder why the configuration didn't apply
```

### Example - Correct Workflow:
```
# DO THIS INSTEAD
1. Edit docker-compose.yaml to change a healthcheck
2. docker-compose down
3. docker-compose up -d
4. Verify configuration with docker-compose ps
```

For services where downtime is critical, consider using rolling updates or maintaining service redundancy.
