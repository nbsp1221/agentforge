# Network Architecture

This project uses a specific network architecture that's important to understand when making changes:

## External Caddy Network

All services connect to an external `caddy-network` which is created separately from this project's docker-compose. This network is used by Caddy reverse proxy to manage external access.

```yaml
networks:
  caddy-network:
    name: caddy-network
    external: true
```

## Service Exposure Policy

Services should **only** use `expose` (not `ports`) to make services available within the internal docker network:

```yaml
expose:
  - 11434  # Example for Ollama
```

**DO NOT** use `ports` mapping since all external access is managed by Caddy reverse proxy. Using `ports` would bypass the reverse proxy security and management.

## Internal Service Communication

Services within the project communicate with each other using their service names as hostnames:
- LiteLLM connects to Ollama at `http://ollama:11434`
- Services connect to PostgreSQL at `postgres:5432`

## External Access

All external access to services must go through Caddy reverse proxy, which is configured in a separate project using the same `caddy-network`.

This architecture ensures:
- Centralized access management
- Consistent security policies
- Proper TLS termination at the proxy level
